Signal Weaver is a responsive show control tool designed for devised dance work. It listens to IMU wearables, turns gesture into data, and drives lighting, projection, and multichannel audio in real time. I led the technical direction, built the software stack, and integrated with venue networking to keep latency under 12ms end-to-end.
