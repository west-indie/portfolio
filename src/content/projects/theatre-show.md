I oversaw all lighting systems for *The 2024 Mesa College New Play Festival*, ensuring a enticing visual experience during each performance. Collaborated with multiple creatives to express their distinct vision, authored show control to let the stage manager call looks with confidence, and built environments that allowed the actors to play and find their light.
